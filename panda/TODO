** Projects **

== ELM327 Emulator ==

Write an elm327 emulator in boardesp/elm327.c and make it work with Torque

You'll find a start at this in the "elm327" branch.

== socketcan Kernel Driver ==

Write a kernel driver version of lib/panda.py that exposes the Panda on socketcan and makes it work with those tools.

You may want to switch to interrupt endpoint first. Should LIN be exposed as a serial interface?

== Windows J2534 DLL ==

Write a Windows DLL that exposes the J2534 API.

Will make the Panda work with car diagnostic software.


** Refactors **

== USB Interrupt Endpoint ==

Switch USB to use an interrupt endpoint instead of a bulk endpoint for can recv

== WebSocket Support ==

Add CAN streaming over WebSocket to the ELM code in addition to the UDP pipe.
